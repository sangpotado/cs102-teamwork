// The idea behind this function is that the program will read the team names from column zero (the winners column) and compare the current team's name to the previous team name(s). Based on the number of previous names that the current name is equal to, the current name will be saved in the corresponding vector. For example: The previous values are Green bay, Miami, SF, SF and the current name is SF. Since SF is equal to the two previous values this must mean that SF won 3 times in a row. Then SF wouls be saved into the winsinarow3 vector. This vector will be printed later. Also SF will then be saved in the preteams vector as well so it can be compared with future team names.

Five in a row should be plenty because a team has never more than twice in a row. There have been 52 super bowls and no team has ever won more than twice in a row. The chances of a team winning 6 super bowls in consecutive years is so so low.
    
    // If you think about it once the program detects a team has won twice in a row it will save that team name into the vector for teams that have won twice in a row. However, lets say a team won three times in a row technically, the team name would first be saved into the vector for teams that have won twice in a row and then it again would be saved into the vector for teams that have won 3 times in row. This does not matter becasue the way the if statments that output data to the user are structred so that they will only print the vector that represents the most amount of wins in a row and nothing else.
