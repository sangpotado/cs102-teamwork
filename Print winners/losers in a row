void printmostwins(team team[99][2], int rows)

// The idea behind this function is that the program will read the team names from column zero (the winners column) and 
// compare the current team's name to the previous team name(s). Based on the number of previous names that the current 
// name is equal to, the current name will be saved in the corresponding vector. For example: The previous values are Green bay, Miami, 
// SF, SF and the current name is SF. Since SF is equal to the two previous values this must mean that SF won 3 times in a row. Then SF 
// wouls be saved into the winsinarow3 vector. This vector will be printed later. Also SF will then be saved in the preteams vector as well so 
// it can be compared with future team names.
